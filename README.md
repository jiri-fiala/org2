# openshift.org

Based on [this re-launch request](https://github.com/openshift/openshift.org/issues/46).

In order to test this locally:

1. Clone the repo or download it
2. Install dependencies by `npm install`
3. Run `grunt` to launch the site using browserSync.

Running `grunt dist` will produce static files for distribution in the `dist/`
directory.
